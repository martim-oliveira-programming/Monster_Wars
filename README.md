# Tearoma Adventures
Tearoma is an RPG inspired by tabletop classics like DnD, where you create your own path.

The story happens in the Tearoma Region; a mysterious land accessible only through a portal that was sealed off from the world we live in today. On this side of the portal, hidden abilities dormant in humans awaken, creating a very different power dynamic between the two worlds.

You don't know why, but you are the only one who can travel between these worlds. You discover this ability by accident and, at first, struggle to find your way back to your family and your world.

What adventures await? That is for you to decide, as your choices shape the entire story.
